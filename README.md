# SoloCanvas

A freeform canvas tool built for solo tabletop RPG players. Place card decks, dice, and images on an infinite canvas, manage your hand, take notes, and save your sessions — all in one window.

> **Platform:** Windows | **Language:** Python 3 + PyQt6 | **License:** GPL-3.0

## Features

- **Infinite canvas** — zoom, pan, and arrange anything freely
- **Card decks** — load image-based decks, draw to hand or canvas, flip, shuffle, search, and reorder
- **Dice** — place physical dice on the canvas; roll with a keypress
- **Image import** — drag in images, paste from clipboard, or import via the Image Library
- **Hand strip** — a persistent card hand at the bottom of the window with drag-to-reorder and multi-select
- **Notepad** — a WYSIWYG Markdown notepad with heading formatting and font controls
- **Sessions** — save and load named sessions with canvas screenshots; autosave on close
- **Canvas theming** — the entire UI derives its colour from the canvas background

## Installation


### Steps

1. **Download the 7z from releases**

   Unzip the file on your drive.

2. **Run EXE**

   Run the SoloCanvas.exe

   Be sure to keep the .exe in the same folder as your /Deck /Dice /Images and /Notes folders.

---

## Launching

### From source

```bash
python main.py
```

Or double-click **`launch.bat`** on Windows — it checks for dependencies, offers to install any that are missing, and launches the app without a terminal window.

### Standalone executable (Windows)

Run **`build.bat`** to produce a self-contained executable using PyInstaller:

```
dist\SoloCanvas\SoloCanvas.exe
```

The build script bundles all dependencies. Copy your `Decks\` folder next to the exe before running.

---

## Adding Decks

SoloCanvas loads card decks from the **`Decks\`** folder next to `main.py` (or the exe).

Each deck is a **subfolder** containing card images and a back image:

```
Decks/
  My Deck/
    card_01.png
    card_02.png
    ...
    back.png          ← must be named "back" (any supported image format)
```

Supported image formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.gif`, `.tiff`, `.webp`

The back image is identified by its filename containing the word `back`. All other images in the folder become cards.

Open the **Deck Library** (`D` key or Tools menu) and double-click a deck to place it on the canvas.

### Drawing Cards

Hover your cursor over a deck on the canvas, then press a number key:

| Key | Action |

### The Hand

The **hand strip** runs along the bottom of the window. Cards drawn to the hand appear here.

The **LIB** button (left side) opens the Deck Library. The **RCL** button returns canvas cards to their decks.

### Stacking Cards

Select multiple card items on the canvas, then right-click → **Stack** to combine them into a new deck-like stack. Stacks behave like decks and can be drawn from, shuffled, and searched.

## Images

### Adding Images

**From the Image Library** (`I` key): browse and place previously imported images.

**Drag and drop**: drag an image file from Windows Explorer onto the canvas.

**Paste from clipboard** (`Ctrl+V`): paste any image copied from a browser, image editor, or file. The image is automatically saved to your local Images folder.

### Image Library

The Image Library (`I`) manages your image collection:

- **Scene tab** — images currently on the canvas
- **Library tab** — all locally saved images

From the Library tab you can:
- **Spawn** an image onto the canvas
- **Rename** an image (right-click → Rename)
- **Delete** an image (with confirmation; warns if in use on canvas)
- **Localize** linked images (copies them into your local folder)
- **Create folders** and **move images** between folders for organisation

---

## Notepad

Press `N` or use the Tools menu to open the **Notepad**.

The Notepad is a WYSIWYG Markdown editor. Files are saved as `.md` and rendered as rich text.

### File Menu

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| New | Start a blank untitled note |
| Open | Open any `.md`, `.html`, or `.txt` file |
| Save | Save the current file (or prompt for location if untitled) |
| Save As | Save to a new location |

The last opened note is remembered and reloaded automatically.

### Formatting

| Button / Key | Format |
|---|---|
| **B** / Ctrl+B | Bold |
| *I* / Ctrl+I | Italic |
| U / Ctrl+U | Underline |
| H1 / Ctrl+1 | Heading 1 |
| H2 / Ctrl+2 | Heading 2 |
| H3 / Ctrl+3 | Heading 3 |

Headings are displayed larger, bold, and underlined (relative to your chosen font size). Clicking a heading button again on an already-formatted line removes the heading.

Use the **Font** and **Size** menus to choose a display font and size. These are display-only preferences — the underlying Markdown is not affected. Settings persist between sessions.

---

## Sessions

### Saving

- **File → Save** — saves to the current named session (or prompts for a name if unsaved)
- **File → Save As** — save under a new name
- Each save includes a **canvas screenshot** stored alongside the session file

### Loading

- **File → Open Session** — browse saved sessions with thumbnail previews
- Sessions can be deleted from the Open Session dialog (click the **✕** button, then confirm)

### Autosave

SoloCanvas autosaves when you close the window:
- If a named session is active, it saves to that session
- Otherwise it saves to a timestamped autosave file

### Startup

On launch, a dialog asks whether to **start a new session** or **load a saved one**.
